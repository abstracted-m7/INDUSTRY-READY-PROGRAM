14. What is scalability ?
=> Scalability determines how well your system can absorb rapid growth in user population.
Types : 
   -Vartical Scalibility : Increse RAM power.
   -Horizontal Scalibility : Increse Hardware power.

15. What is ELB ?
=> When increse the trafic in a server then ELB increse the scalability of that server.
-Using Algorithm : Round Robin(RR)


16. What is access Specifier and types ?
=> How the Outsider class access the other class it determine by the access specifer.
- public - members are accessible from outside the class.
- private - members cannot be accessed (or viewed) from outside the class.
